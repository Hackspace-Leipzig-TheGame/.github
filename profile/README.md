# Welcome to the Hackspace-Leipzig "The Game" Project
This should be a place for us to explore different technologies by implementing on game in different versions.

WE shape this project and need YOUR help to make this work. Feel free to help whereever you can.

Please read the [Documentation](https://github.com/Hackspace-Leipzig-TheGame/Documentation) and follow the specifications.
